# Shedding Light on AI: Coding Creative Tech Stories

This workshop introduces participants to the basics of coding with Arduino and Neopixel LEDs, blending technology with storytelling. Using a 24-LED Neopixel ring, students will learn to create dynamic light effects that represent themes or interactions inspired by AI. 

Through hands-on coding and creative discussions, participants will explore the impact of AI while crafting tech-driven narratives. Perfect for beginners, this workshop sparks curiosity about both programming and the role of AI in society.



## Key Features
- **Learn to code with Arduino**: Step-by-step guidance on programming an Arduino Uno and controlling Neopixel LEDs.
- **Creative storytelling**: Link your light effects to thought-provoking AI-inspired narratives.
- **Explore AI concepts**: Discuss the societal implications, challenges, and potential of artificial intelligence.
- **Hands-on experimentation**: Create your own light patterns and animations with a 24-LED Neopixel ring.



## Ideal For
- Beginners with no prior experience in programming or electronics.
- Students and hobbyists interested in technology, creativity, and AI.
- Anyone curious about how coding can be used as a tool for storytelling.
